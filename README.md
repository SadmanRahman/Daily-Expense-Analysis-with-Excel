Personal Financial Hacks:
Iâ€™m launching my personal financial analysis for July 2025. The goal of this project was simple: to apply an Analystâ€™s mindset to personal life and make more informed financial decisions. Through this dashboard, I was able to track spending behavior, identify major expense areas, and find opportunities to reduce unnecessary costs â€” ultimately increasing real income.
